          <p className="mt-6 text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
            Ressurreccion is a study in restraint and intention. We craft premium streetwear as modern armor — precise, architectural, and emotionally charged. Each piece is designed with minimal lines, engineered fabrics, and an obsession with detail.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
            Inspired by the raw energy of the street and the refined language of luxury fashion, our collections merge movement with stillness, softness with structure. Monochrome palettes amplify silhouette and texture, turning simplicity into statement.
          </p>

            "Rebirth of Street Elegance" is more than a tagline — it's a manifesto. The past informs us. The future drives us. The present demands presence.
